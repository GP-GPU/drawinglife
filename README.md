This [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) application was
developed in collaboration with
[plan b performance](http://www.planbperformance.net/) for visualizing
GPS data.

Some of the project's outcome can be viewed
[here](http://vimeo.com/36858805) and [here](http://vimeo.com/21772894)

We are starting to gather documentation on the wiki [here](https://github.com/ptrv/drawinglife/wiki)
